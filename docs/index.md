# Employee Attrition MLOps Project

Welcome to the Employee Attrition MLOps project documentation. This project implements a complete MLOps pipeline for predicting employee attrition using machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a production-ready MLOps implementation with:

- Automated model training and evaluation
- Continuous monitoring and drift detection
- Automated retraining when needed
- API deployment and management
- Comprehensive testing and CI/CD pipeline
